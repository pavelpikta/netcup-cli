## [1.0.0] - 2025-02-19

### Added

- Initial release.
- **Auth:** Device-code login, logout, revoke, show credentials path.
- **Servers:** list, get, power, set-hostname, set-nickname; disks (list, get, supported-drivers, set-driver, format); interfaces (list, get, create, update, delete); firewall (get, put, reapply, restore-copied-policies); ISO (get, attach, detach, images); snapshots (list, get, create, delete, export, revert, dryrun); rescue (get, activate, deactivate); metrics (cpu, disk, network, packet); logs list; image (flavours, setup); user-image setup; guest-agent get; storage-optimization start.
- **rDNS:** IPv4 and IPv6 get, set, delete.
- **Tasks:** list (with -q, --server-id, --state), get, cancel (PUT per OpenAPI).
- **Users:** info, get, update; failoverips v4/v6 list and route; firewall-policies list, get, create, update, delete; ssh-keys list, add, delete; vlans list, get, update; images list, delete, download-url; isos list, delete, download-url; logs list. Optional `--user-id` for all user-scoped commands.
- **VLANs:** Standalone `vlans get <vlan_id>`.
- **Maintenance:** ping (with Accept: text/plain to avoid 406), info.
- Credentials stored under `~/.config/netcup-cli/` (XDG_CONFIG_HOME). Only refresh token is stored; access token obtained on demand.
- Comprehensive README and production-oriented documentation.

### Fixed

- `maintenance ping` returning 406: request now sends `Accept: text/plain` for the ping endpoint.
- Task cancel: use PUT instead of POST per OpenAPI spec.
